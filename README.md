# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```

### To run this in localnet

- If getting error while creating account, please clear activity and nonce data of account from Advance setting
- run local hardhat network and deploy contract
- connect hardhat account by improting using private key
- create account in Message app

### some importtant link

You can deploy your contrat from remix for testnet. Just change you network contect to an account. Then compile contract and deploy contract on that network.

- [Testnet bscscan](https://testnet.bscscan.com/) - use this network to deploy you contract on testnet
- [bnb faucet](https://www.bnbchain.org/en/testnet-faucet) - use this link to get bnb network faucet
